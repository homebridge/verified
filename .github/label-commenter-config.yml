          ```

          Your plugin is now also eligible to display a *:heart: Donate* button on its tile in the Homebridge UI. See https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Donation-Links for instructions.

          If for any reason in the future you can no longer maintain your plugin, please consider transferring it to our [unmaintained plugins repo](https://github.com/homebridge/unmaintained-plugins). We can take ownership until another willing developer comes along.

          Don't forget to join the official [Homebridge Discord server](https://discord.gg/A7nCjbz), where plugin developers can get tips and advice from other developers and the Homebridge project team in the #plugin-development channel!

          As a verified plugin, you can request a channel in the Discord server to discuss your plugin with users and other developers. Just ask in the #plugin-development channel.

          Thank you for your contribution to the Homebridge community.
